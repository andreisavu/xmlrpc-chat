Simple python xmlrpc chat client & server prototype

This is a simple prototype for chat system based on xmlrpc.
The server stores all the messages and the user list only in memory.

The client interface uses curses and can be used from the cli.

Server start:
 ./sever.py [port]

Client:
 ./client.py [username] [server_url]

By default the server will start on port 8000 and the client will
try to connect to http://localhost:8000/

The client accepts the following commands:
/quit - end session and exit
/list - list current online users
/help - list available commands
